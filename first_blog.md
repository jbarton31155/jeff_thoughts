Oh hey - didn't see you there! I couldn't be more excited that you have decided to join me on this blourney (blog + journey). First, let's knock a few administrative things out of the way.

I have decided to start a blog because Twitter is no longer capable of handling my thoughts. 
The 140 character limit seems sort of arbitrary - and I hate arbitration.
My feelings towards Twitter are best encapsulated by the classic jam "Club Can't Handle Me Right Now". 
I haven't had a chance to listen to that song yet, but the title really says it all.
And it relates to my situation in that I now feel that "Twitter Can't Handle Me Right Now".

Just imagine if JK Rowling tried to write Harry Potter on Twitter in 140 characters or less.
Or if the Declaration of Independece had to be squeezed into a single tweet. Scary to think about isn't it? Let's not.
The point I am trying to make is greatness cannot be achieved in 140 characters or less.

### A couple of quick notes:
+ My mastery of the English language is weak at best. I will often use words that I think fit, but probably not.
  - My hope is that you find my lack of writing ability a nice change of pace.
+ The original intent of this blog was to provide career advice to my friends, family, and colleagues.
  - If I happen to get sidetracked at times, that's okay! I will go where my thoughts take me.
+ This is a family friendly blog so please feel free to read with your kids!
+ Spell check doesn't seem to be available on this platform - you should be able to determine what I mean should I happen to make a tipo. Let's not be nit-picky!

### Important Message:
I personally think 'like' buttons are over-rated. They are everywhere and liking a facebook post or tweet is pretty insignificant. That's why I won't have any 'like' buttons on my blog. What I will implement instead is a [GoFundMe page](https://www.gofundme.com/support-for-jeffthoughts-blog). I know you're probably thinking "this guy sucks" or "I'm not giving him my money". But let me challenge you to look at it from my perspective. It would be great to be paid for writing this blog. Also this would ensure that I don't get any phony likes. Instead of 'likes' I will use $ amounts received as my metric for blog success. This will allow me to no what is working and what isn't and curate content for the greater good of my audience. Also I only need $2.99 (per month) and I can put the blog on an actual website - you will see huge benefits from this I think!

There are more administrative pieces I want to cover but I want to make sure this blog gets popular before I get into too much of that. So let's dive into my first piece of career advice.

Ready? Ok cool.

## 1.) Re-think your e-mail strategy
Ever write an e-mail and just hit send? That's great but isn't going to get you that promotion anytime soon (anyone can send an e-mail). Instead try this approach:

1. Write e-mail.
2. Make sure it looks good.
+ Run a quick spell check, make sure if you said you were attaching a file that it's actually attached etc.
3. Ask yourself this question - is this time sensitive?
  + Most of the time the answer to this is "No".
4. If you answered "Yes" you can stop reading.
5. If you are still reading this you answered "No" - smart move friend!
6. I know it sounds irresponsible but hold off on sending the e-mail.
7. Continue your day and forget about the e-mail.
8. If it's getting late in the day (say 10 PM), maybe start to think about hitting the sack.
9. Once you've decided to go to bed - STOP.
10. Log on to your computer.
11. Click send on that e-mail we were just talking about.
12. Now the e-mail has been sent - wonderful!

I hope the above instructions were clear! If you implement this strategy as part of your daily workflow you'll notice a couple of things.

1. Your colleagues and clients will assume (incorrectly) that you will go the extra mile to get your work done.
2. You will be viewed as a "team player" - this is a good thing.
3. You will garner much more respect from whoever happened to be on that e-mail thread that you replied to late at night.
4. A couple of times during the year after you send that late e-mail, make sure to get in the office really early the next day. It will have people saying "Man, that girl is the 1st on in the office and the last one to leave". 
+ They often say this about really good athletes like Jay Cutler or Dennis Rodman. Soon they will see your face and associate it with greatness.

Did you find that helpful? 

Awesome - happy to hear it! If you could show me in $ how great you thought it was that would be great. Head on over to my [GoFundMe page](https://www.gofundme.com/support-for-jeffthoughts-blog) now!




Thanks for tuning in! Not really sure how to end a blog post...
