Oh hey - didn't see you there! I couldn't be more excited that you have decided to join me on this blourney (blog + journey). 

I have decided to start a blog because Twitter is no longer capable of handling my thoughts. 
The 140 character limit seems sort of arbitrary - and I hate arbitration.
My feelings towards Twitter are best encapsulated by the classic jam "Club Can't Handle Me Right Now". 
I haven't had a chance to listen to that song yet, but the title really says it all.
And it relates to my situation in that I now feel that "Twitter Can't Handle Me Right Now".

Just imagine if JK Rowling tried to write Harry Potter on Twitter in 140 characters or less.
Or if the Declaration of Independece had to be squeezed into a single tweet. Scary to think about isn't it? Let's not.
The point I am trying to make is greatness cannot be achieved in 140 characters or less.

A couple of quick notes:
+ My mastery of the English language is weak at best. I will often use words that I think fit, but probably not.
  - My hope is that you find my lack of writing ability a nice change of pace.
+ The original intent of this blog was to provide career advice to my friends, family, and colleagues.
  - If I happen to get sidetracked at times, that's okay!
